End To End Development of Supervised Machine Learning Model(Regression Problem) 

# Business Problem/Problem Statement

For a given location in Bangalore City, our goal is to predict the price of property. Some locations have higher prices than other locations owing to the presence schools, hospitals, offices etc. The prediction result can be transferred to the real estate companies via Smartphone app, and they can buy and sell properties in order to increase their profit.

# Objectives & Constraints

## Objectives: 
Our objective is to predict the price of the property as accurately as possible for each region. We will break up the whole Bangalore City into regions, so that we can look into things clearly.

## Constraints:
 * Loss Function: Mean Square Error will be taken as the loss function. Accuracy of the model is predicted on the bases of adjusted R-square.
***Our goal is to reduce the mean square error as low as possible.***

# Source of Data
Data can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data

# Getting Started

Start by downloading the project and run "Bengaluru_House_Data.ipynb" file in ipython-notebook.

# Prerequisites

You need to have installed following softwares and libraries in your machine before running this project.

* Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Anaconda: It will install ipython notebook and most of the libraries which are needed like sklearn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy and scipy: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

# Libraries:

* scikit-learn(sklearn) :- It provides all in-built method for machine learning pipeline.

# Notes:

* Proper Data Science Pipeline is followed.
* Data Cleansing, Feature Engineering, Outlier removal and model building (Training and Testing) is done.
* Accuracy of the model is nearly 85%.

# Improvements:
 ## Here are few improvements need to be done will be doing shortly :
 
 * Boosting the model using XGBoost ensemble.
 * Considering few features like Area-Type and Society to increase the accuracy of the model.
